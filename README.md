*C++ Programming Language* â€¢ *

# CPP Modules

This project is about discovering the C++ programming language. It is composed of 10 modules, each one covering a specific part of the language.

| Module | About |
|:---:|:---|
| [00](https://github.com/nfauconn/cpp/tree/main/cpp00) | Namespaces, Classes, Member Functions, Stdio Streams, Initialization Lists, Static, Const (and some other basic stuff) |
| [01](https://github.com/nfauconn/cpp/tree/main/cpp01) | Memory Allocation, Pointers to Members, References, Switch Statement |
| [02](https://github.com/nfauconn/cpp/tree/main/cpp02) | Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operators Overload, Canonical Classes |
| [03](https://github.com/nfauconn/cpp/tree/main/cpp03) | Inheritance |
| [04](https://github.com/nfauconn/cpp/tree/main/cpp04) | Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces |
| [05](https://github.com/nfauconn/cpp/tree/main/cpp05) | Repetition and Exceptions |
| [06](https://github.com/nfauconn/cpp/tree/main/cpp06) | Casts |
| [07](https://github.com/nfauconn/cpp/tree/main/cpp07) | Templates |
| [08](https://github.com/nfauconn/cpp/tree/main/cpp08) | Templated Containers, Iterators, Algorithms |
| [09](https://github.com/nfauconn/cpp/tree/main/cpp09) | STL Containers |
